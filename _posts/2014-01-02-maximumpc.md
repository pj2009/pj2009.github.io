description: This is a project from one of my publishing courses. I was asked to design a new magazine or redesign an existing one. I chose to redesign a magazine called "Maximum PC" which focuses on computer hardwares and consumer electronics. My task was to create a cover, a table of content, as well as spreads including a featured story for the magazine .
