description: Bohate is a mockup of a e-commerce website. In this project, me and my teammate were asked to design a website for a local boat business. The website is coded using basic HTML and CSS with several jQuery plugins. In order to provide optimal viewing experience, the entire website is responsive and can be adapted to any mobile devices.

process: Throughout this project, I used text editing program Subline Text to code the entire website. It reinforced my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I also learned basic use of Javascript and jQuery library. jQuery plugins were implemented within the website. The layout of the website is a combination of fluid layout and elastic page design. The mix of two design approaches enhanced the browsing experience across different platforms.
