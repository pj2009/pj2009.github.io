description: Sonare is a concept that we develop for the "Creatives of the Year Competition" in SIAT, SFU. It is an application that helps us exchange personal information more efficiently and find potential employers/employees in public space. As the ux designer in the team, my goal was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for our target audience. With that in mind, we created some mockups of the application in order to demonstrate how the application works. 

process: Our project was nominated as one of the final 5 in the competition.
