description: Student Information System (SIS) is a university's records and enrollment management system for students of Simon Fraser University. The current system has been known for its frustrating user experience. Especially the enrollment system students have to undergo from term to term. Due to students' urge for a redesign, our team decided to redesign the enrollment system and enhance the usability and user experience of the current system.
process: The video was awarded second place in the SFU SIAT Showcase 2012 under "Moving Images" category.
