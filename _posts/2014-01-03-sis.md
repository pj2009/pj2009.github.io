description: Student Information System (SIS) is a university's records and enrollment management system for students of Simon Fraser University. The current system has been known for its frustrating user experience. Especially the enrollment system students have to undergo from term to term. Due to students' urge for a redesign, our team decided to redesign the enrollment system and enhance the usability and user experience of the current system.

process: Participated in the design process of the project including research, brainstorming and prototyping. Created digital prototype using Illustrator and Dreamweaver. Helped conduct the user testing sessions and collected user feedback. Directed and shot the promotional video for the project. Nominated and awarded second place in SIAT showcase 2013. Practiced and strengthened my ability to work in a large team and gained valuable experience in user interface/user experience design.
