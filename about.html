	<h2>Who I Am<span>:</span></h2>
	<p>Hello! I am a senior design student studying at Simon Fraser University in the <a href="http://www.siat.sfu.ca/">School of Interactive Arts and Technology</a>. UI/UX design is what brought me into this field and I love exploring new things with emerging technologies. Being a UI/UX designer gives me an opportunity to develop interfaces for next generation mobile devices. With the love for UI/UX design, I recently started my study in mobile computing which helps me create actual applications implementing my interface design.</p>
