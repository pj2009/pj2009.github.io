description: Planet of Insects is a 2D adventure/puzzle game we designed for an advance game design course at SFU. We were given about 3 months to develop a complete, playable game as our final project. The game was created by Game Maker and all the game mechanics are all fully functioning as we originally proposed. The game features one core game mechanic and multiple secondary game mechanics. There are 3 different territories and 9 maps in this game. The game also includes a final stage where you have to defeat the boss in order to complete the game.

process: Worked with graphic artists and created series of avatars and sprites. Coded and created a playable game executable using Game Maker. Embedded an original AI system using a combination of different programming languages such as C++, C and Java in Game Maker. Gained knowledge and experience in game design.
