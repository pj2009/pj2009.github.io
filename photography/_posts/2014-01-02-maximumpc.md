description: This is a project from one of my publishing courses. I was asked to design a new magazine or redesign an existing one. I chose to redesign a magazine called "Maximum PC" which focuses on computer hardwares and consumer electronics. My task was to create a cover, a table of content, as well as spreads including a featured story for the magazine . 

process: Conducted a series of research on the demographics of the magazine readers. Used thumbnails and quick sketches to draft ideas. Then Adobe illustrator was used to create mockups of magazine spreads and cover. Gained valuable experience in print and magazine design and had a basic understanding of the publishing industry.
