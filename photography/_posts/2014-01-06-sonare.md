description: Sonare is a concept that we develop for the "Creatives of the Year Competition" in SIAT, SFU. It is an application that helps us exchange personal information more efficiently and find potential employers/employees in public space. As the ux designer in the team, my goal was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for our target audience. With that in mind, we created some mockups of the application in order to demonstrate how the application works. 

process: The goal of the contest was to design a concept where technology can benefit our everyday life. We had the option to reinvent an existing technology or create our own design. Our team decided to design an application that will change the way which people used to exchange personal information.  In this project, I was responsible for creating wireframes and mockups for the application. I also designed the icon of the application based on our concept and the features of our application. As a result, our project was nominated as one of the final five teams in the competition.
